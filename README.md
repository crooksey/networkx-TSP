networkx-TSP
============

Using NetworkX to plot a map between points, with example data. Currently this
code only works by manually assigning the edges and the routes.

TO-DO
-----
Implement a TSP solver to calculate most efficent way from point A to point B,
then plot all edges in sequence and draw a map. (Probably using OpenOpt)
